    "_Arakawa Reports_ are data-centric documents which you can generate using Python. You can think of them as replacements for sending a PDF or PowerPoint, and they can be exported as standalone HTML files and sent over Slack or Email. Reports are often created programmatically from inside other platforms, such as a data pipelines (_\"LightGBM training results v230\"_), CI, or generated on a cadence (_\"Monday's sales forecast\"_).\n",
