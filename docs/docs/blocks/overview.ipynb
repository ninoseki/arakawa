    "Reports are comprised of multiple _Blocks_, which wrap up Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames, visualizations, and Markdown. Arakawa also includes interactive layout blocks to add tabs, pages, and selects to your reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Blocks_ can be combined together and nested. For instance, you can pass multiple plots into a `Select` to provide an interactive dropdown. This makes it simple to assemble complex, reusable interfaces and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! tip\n",
    "    You can think of blocks as similar to HTML Elements / Tags, but specialized on creating data-driven reports\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of Blocks provided by default in Arakawa:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Display Blocks](./display-blocks.ipynb) display data and visualizations, such as a Plot (ar.Plot) or a DataTable (ar.DataTable). They take Python objects, such as Panda DataFrames, and automatically convert them into a component that can be viewed in your report.\n",
    "2. [Layout Blocks](./layout-blocks.ipynb) can be used to layout other Blocks. For instance, `ar.Group` can group blocks together in columns, or `ar.Select` allows a user to select between multiple blocks. They take other Blocks as their input and lay them out to help build complex and visually informative layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example that demonstrates building up a collection of blocks, including BigNumber to display high-level data, a Plot block, and multiple tabs and columns."
